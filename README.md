# Emoji-Space-War
CMSI 185 Final Project
In this game, you are an emoji in space trying to run away from the evil alien emojis! You are able to kill the emojis by pressing the “k” button on your keyboard. If an evil alien emoji attacks you your health will decrease, but don’t worry every round a heart will appear grab it to add to your health! Lastly, every 5 rounds a spaceship will pass through the galaxy distracting the evil alien emojis allowing you to do whatever you want in that round! Good luck!!
